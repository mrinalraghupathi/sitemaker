sitemaker
=========
This is a simple static site generator written in python. At the moment it's probably not quite good enough to be used by anyone else, since it it's usage is not documented very well. 
  
TODO
====
  - Write documentation and provide example site
  - Create default handlers to process Sass, minify JS/CSS
